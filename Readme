This is a game I made using Java's Applet and Graphics libraries. (Applet libraries are deprecated and no longer supported in latest version of java)

HOW-TO: 
Run Server-
	Run the ServerRun
	start server

Run Client-
	Edit IP in code (around line 80)
	Run ClientRun, (make sure server is active) 
	Click on the Applet. Enter your username. 
	You should be connected now.

Playing the game-
	WASD to move
	R to Ready up (will start the game when 100% of players are ready) (this starts/resets the game)
	SPACEBAR to use skill (automagicly assigns teleport to player, teleports to shadow character under mouse)
	ENTER to start a message, Enter again to send.
